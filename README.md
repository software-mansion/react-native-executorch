**React Native ExecuTorch** is a declarative way to run AI models in React Native on device, powered by **ExecuTorch** ðŸš€.

**ExecuTorch** is a novel framework created by Meta that enables running AI models on devices such as mobile phones or microcontrollers. React Native ExecuTorch bridges the gap between React Native and native platform capabilities, allowing developers to run AI models locally on mobile devices with state-of-the-art performance, without requiring deep knowledge of native code or machine learning internals.

## Readymade models ðŸ¤–

To run any AI model in ExecuTorch, you need to export it to a `.pte` format. If you're interested in experimenting with your own models, we highly encourage you to check out the [Python API](https://pypi.org/project/executorch/). If you prefer focusing on developing your React Native app, we will cover several common use cases. For more details, please refer to the documentation.

## Documentation ðŸ“š

Take a look at how our library can help build you your React Native AI features in our docs:  
https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-executorch

## Examples ðŸ“²

We currently host a single example demonstrating a chat app built with the latest **LLaMa 3.2 1B/3B** model. If you'd like to run it, navigate to `examples/llama` from the repository root and install the dependencies with:

```bash
yarn
```

then run:

```bash
cd ios
pod install
```

And finally, if you want to run on Android:

```bash
yarn expo run:android
```

or iOS:

```bash
yarn expo run:ios
```

## What's next?

- Support for various common use cases such as object detection, segmentation etc.  

- A possibility to run your own ExecuTorch models
