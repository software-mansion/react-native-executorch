**React Native ExecuTorch** is a declarative way to run AI models in React Native on device, powered by **ExecuTorch** üöÄ.

**ExecuTorch** is a novel framework created by Meta that enables running AI models on devices such as mobile phones or microcontrollers. React Native ExecuTorch bridges the gap between React Native and native platform capabilities, allowing developers to run AI models locally on mobile devices with state-of-the-art performance, without requiring deep knowledge of native code or machine learning internals.

## Compatibility

React Native Executorch supports only the [New React Native architecture](https://reactnative.dev/architecture/landing-page).

If your app still runs on the old architecture, please consider upgrading to the New Architecture.

## Ready-made models ü§ñ

To run any AI model in ExecuTorch, you need to export it to a `.pte` format. If you're interested in experimenting with your own models, we highly encourage you to check out the [Python API](https://pypi.org/project/executorch/). If you prefer focusing on developing your React Native app, we will cover several common use cases. For more details, please refer to the documentation.

## Documentation üìö

Take a look at how our library can help build you your React Native AI features in our docs:  
https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-executorch

## **Quickstart - Running Llama** ü¶ô

**Get started with AI-powered text generation in 3 easy steps!**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Installation**

```bash
# Install the package
yarn add react-native-executorch
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Setup & Initialization**

Add this to your component file:

```tsx
import {
  useLLM,
  LLAMA3_2_1B,
  LLAMA3_2_TOKENIZER,
  LLAMA3_2_TOKENIZER_CONFIG,
} from 'react-native-executorch';

function MyComponent() {
  // Initialize the model üöÄ
  const llama = useLLM({
    modelSource: LLAMA3_2_1B,
    tokenizerSource: LLAMA3_2_TOKENIZER,
    tokenizerConfigSource: LLAMA3_2_TOKENIZER_CONFIG,
  });
  // ... rest of your component
}
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Run the model!**

```tsx
const handleGenerate = async () => {
  const chat = [
    { role: 'system' content: 'You are a helpful assistant' }
    { role: 'user', content: 'What is the meaning of life?' }
  ];

  // Chat completion
  await llm.generate(chat);
  console.log('Llama says:', llm.response);
};
```

## Minimal supported versions

The minimal supported version are: 
* iOS 17.0
* Android 13

## Examples üì≤

We currently host a few example apps demonstrating use cases of our library:

- `examples/llm` - chat application showcasing use of LLMs
- `examples/speech-to-text` - Whisper and Moonshine models ready for transcription tasks
- `examples/computer-vision` - computer vision related tasks
- `examples/text-embeddings` - computing text representations for semantic search

If you would like to run it, navigate to it's project directory, for example `examples/llm` from the repository root and install dependencies with:

```bash
yarn
```

then run:

```bash
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
```

And finally, if you want to run on Android:

```bash
yarn expo run:android
```

or iOS:

```bash
yarn expo run:ios
```

### Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è

Running LLMs requires a significant amount of RAM. If you are encountering unexpected app crashes, try to increase the amount of RAM allocated to the emulator.
