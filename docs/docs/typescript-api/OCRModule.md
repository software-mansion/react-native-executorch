Hookless implementation of the [useOCR](../computer-vision/useOCR.md) hook.

## Reference

```typescript
import {
  OCRModule,
  CRAFT_800,
  RECOGNIZER_EN_CRNN_512,
  RECOGNIZER_EN_CRNN_256,
  RECOGNIZER_EN_CRNN_128,
} from 'react-native-executorch';
const imageUri = 'path/to/image.png';

// Loading the model
await OCRModule.load({
  detectorSource: CRAFT_800,
  recognizerSources: {
    recognizerLarge: RECOGNIZER_EN_CRNN_512,
    recognizerMedium: RECOGNIZER_EN_CRNN_256,
    recognizerSmall: RECOGNIZER_EN_CRNN_128,
  },
  language: 'en',
});

// Running the model
const ocrDetections = await OCRModule.forward(imageUri);
```

| `load`               | `(detectorSource: string, recognizerSources: RecognizerSources, language: OCRLanguage): Promise<void>` | Loads the detector and recognizers, which sources are represented by `RecognizerSources`.                |

## Loading the model

To load the model, use the `load` method. It accepts:

**`detectorSource`** - A string that specifies the location of the detector binary. For more information, take a look at [loading models](../fundamentals/loading-models.md) section.

**`recognizerSources`** - An object that specifies locations of the recognizers binary files. Each recognizer is composed of three models tailored to process images of varying widths.

- `recognizerLarge` - A string that specifies the location of the recognizer binary file which accepts input images with a width of 512 pixels.
- `recognizerMedium` - A string that specifies the location of the recognizer binary file which accepts input images with a width of 256 pixels.
- `recognizerSmall` - A string that specifies the location of the recognizer binary file which accepts input images with a width of 128 pixels.

For more information, take a look at [loading models](../fundamentals/loading-models.md) section.

**`language`** - A parameter that specifies the language of the text to be recognized by the OCR.

This method returns a promise, which can resolve to an error or void.

## Listening for download progress

To subscribe to the download progress event, you can use the `onDownloadProgress` method. It accepts a callback function that will be called whenever the download progress changes.

## Running the model

To run the model, you can use the `forward` method. It accepts one argument, which is the image. The image can be a remote URL, a local file URI, or a base64-encoded image. The method returns a promise, which can resolve either to an error or an array of `OCRDetection` objects. Each object contains coordinates of the bounding box, the label of the detected object, and the confidence score.
