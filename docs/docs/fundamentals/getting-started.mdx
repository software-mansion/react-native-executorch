## What is ExecuTorch?
ExecuTorch is a novel AI framework developed by Meta, designed to streamline deploying PyTorch models on a variety of devices, including mobile phones and microcontrollers. This framework enables exporting models into standalone binaries, allowing them to run locally without requiring API calls. ExecuTorch achieves state-of-the-art performance through optimizations and delegates such as CoreML and XNNPack. It provides a seamless export process with robust debugging options, making it easier to resolve issues if they arise.

## React Native ExecuTorch
React Native ExecuTorch is our way of bringing ExecuTorch into the React Native world. Our API is built to be simple, declarative, and efficient. Plus, weâ€™ll provide a set of pre-exported models for common use cases, so you wonâ€™t have to worry about handling exports yourself. With just a few lines of JavaScript, youâ€™ll be able to run AI models (even LLMs ðŸ‘€) right on your deviceâ€”keeping user data private and saving on cloud costs.

## Installation
Installation is pretty straightforward, just use your favorite package manager.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">

    npm install react-native-executorch

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="PNPM">

    pnpm install react-native-executorch

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="YARN">

    yarn add react-native-executorch

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

If you plan on adding your models to the assets instead of fetching them from a url, you also need to add following lines to your `metro.config.js`:

```json
// metro.config.js
...
    defaultConfig.resolver.assetExts.push('pte')
    defaultConfig.resolver.assetExts.push('bin')
...
```

This allows us to use binaries, such as exported models or tokenizers for LLMs.

:::caution[Caution]
When using Expo, please note that you need to use a custom development build of your app, not the standard Expo Go app. This is because we rely on native modules, which Expo Go doesnâ€™t support.
:::

Running the app with the library:
```bash
yarn run expo:<ios | android> -d
```
