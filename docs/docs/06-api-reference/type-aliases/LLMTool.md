Defined in: [packages/react-native-executorch/src/types/llm.ts:197](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-executorch/blob/b5d7c2240b2bce86e529b0ca3bde7420456f9dbe/packages/react-native-executorch/src/types/llm.ts#L197)

Represents a tool that can be used by the model.
Usually tool is represented with dictionary (Object), but fields depend on the model.
Unfortunately there's no one standard so it's hard to type it better.
