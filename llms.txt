# React Native ExecuTorch

> React Native ExecuTorch brings Meta's ExecuTorch AI framework into the React Native ecosystem, enabling developers to run AI models and LLMs locally, directly on mobile devices. It provides a declarative API for on-device inference, allowing you to use local AI models without relying on cloud infrastructure. Built on the ExecuTorch foundation - part of the PyTorch Edge ecosystem - it extends efficient on-device AI deployment to cross-platform mobile applications in React Native.


## Fundamentals

- [Frequently Asked Questions](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-executorch/docs/fundamentals/frequently-asked-questions.md): This section is meant to answer some common community inquiries, especially regarding the ExecuTorch runtime or adding your own models. If you can't see an answer to your question, feel free to open up a discussion.
- [Getting Started](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-executorch/docs/fundamentals/getting-started.md): Get started with React Native ExecuTorch - a framework for running AI models on-device in your React Native applications.
- [Glossary of Terms](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-executorch/docs/fundamentals/glossary-of-terms.md): This glossary defines key concepts used throughout the React Native ExecuTorch ecosystem, covering high-level machine learning terms and library-specific components.
- [Loading Models](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-executorch/docs/fundamentals/loading-models.md): There are three different methods available for loading model files, depending on their size and location.

## Hooks

- [useClassification](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-executorch/docs/hooks/computer-vision/useClassification.md): Image classification is the process of assigning a label to an image that best describes its contents. For example, when given an image of a puppy, the image classifier should assign the puppy class to that image.
- [useImageEmbeddings](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-executorch/docs/hooks/computer-vision/useImageEmbeddings.md): Learn how to use image embeddings models in your React Native applications with React Native ExecuTorch's useImageEmbeddings hook.
- [useImageSegmentation](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-executorch/docs/hooks/computer-vision/useImageSegmentation.md): Semantic image segmentation, akin to image classification, tries to assign the content of the image to one of the predefined classes. However, in case of segmentation this classification is done on a per-pixel basis, so as the result the model provides an image-sized array of scores for each of the classes. You can then use this information to detect objects on a per-pixel basis. React Native ExecuTorch offers a dedicated hook useImageSegmentation for this task.
- [useObjectDetection](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-executorch/docs/hooks/computer-vision/useObjectDetection.md): Object detection is a computer vision technique that identifies and locates objects within images or video. It’s commonly used in applications like image recognition, video surveillance or autonomous driving.
- [useOCR](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-executorch/docs/hooks/computer-vision/useOCR.md): Optical character recognition (OCR) is a computer vision technique that detects and recognizes text within the image. It's commonly used to convert different types of documents, such as scanned paper documents, PDF files, or images captured by a digital camera, into editable and searchable data.
- [useStyleTransfer](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-executorch/docs/hooks/computer-vision/useStyleTransfer.md): Style transfer is a technique used in computer graphics and machine learning where the visual style of one image is applied to the content of another. This is achieved using algorithms that manipulate data from both images, typically with the aid of a neural network. The result is a new image that combines the artistic elements of one picture with the structural details of another, effectively merging art with traditional imagery. React Native ExecuTorch offers a dedicated hook useStyleTransfer, for this task. However before you start you'll need to obtain ExecuTorch-compatible model binary.
- [useTextToImage](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-executorch/docs/hooks/computer-vision/useTextToImage.md): Learn how to use image generation models in your React Native applications with React Native ExecuTorch's useTextToImage hook.
